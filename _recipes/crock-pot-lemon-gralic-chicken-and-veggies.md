ingredients:  2 lbs. red potatoes (quartered), 1 sweet yellow onion (quartered), 1 lb. carrots (sliced into 2-3 inch pieces), 6 bone in and skin on chicken thighs, 1/4 cup olive oil, 3 Tablespoons lemon juice, 4 cloves garlic, 1 lemon (sliced), 3 sprigs rosemary (stems removed and chopped), 6 sprigs fresh thyme (leaves removed), Kosher salt and fresh ground pepper

1. Place the potatoes, onions, and carrots in the bottom of a large slow cooker. Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Stir in two cloves of garlic and half of the fresh herbs.
2. Sprinkle the chicken thighs generously with salt and pepper then nestle them in with the potatoes and carrots. Pour the olive oil evenly over top, followed by the lemon juice and herbs. Place the lemon slices over top.
3. Cook on high for four hours or on low for 8 hours. When the chicken is finished, remove the sliced lemon, squeezing it out a bit if you want extra lemony flavor. Preheat the broiled and place the chicken thighs on a pan under the broiler for 3-4 minutes or until browned and crisp. Serve immediately with the vegetables.
