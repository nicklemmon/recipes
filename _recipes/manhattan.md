ingredients:	2 ounces rye whiskey, 1 ounce italian vermouth, 2 dashes Angostura Bittters, 1 cocktail glass
---

1. Stir the rye, vermouth and bitters well with cracked ice. (Some prefer to shake their Manhattans. There's nothing wrong with that, really, at least no more than putting ketchup on a hot-dog is wrong or mayonnaise on a corned beef sandwich. If you like your Manhattan cloudy and topped with an algae-like foam, shake away. It won't taste any worse, anyway, although it'll feel thinner on the tongue.)
2. Strain into in a chilled cocktail glass and garnish with twist or, of course, maraschino cherry (which is subject to the same challenge re: purity as adding an olive to a martini).
