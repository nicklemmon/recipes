#=== Stuff for the ingredients list ===#
ingredients: 2 cups butternut squash (peeled and cubed), 2 cups carrots (peeled and sliced), 2 cups potatoes (chopped), 2 cups celery (chopped), 1 cup green lentils, ¾ cup yellow split peas (or just use more lentils), 1 onion (chopped), 5 cloves garlic (minced), 8-10 cups vegetable or chicken broth, 2 teaspoons herbs de provence, 1 teaspoon salt (more to taste), 2-3 cups kale (stems removed, chopped), 1 cup parsley (chopped), ½ cup olive oil - rosemary olive oil or other herb infused oil is delicious
a swish of sherry, red wine vinegar, or lemon juice to add a nice tangy bite

1. Place all ingredients in the crockpot. Cover and cook on high for 5-6 hours or low for 7-8 hours.
2. Place about 4 cups of soup in a blender with the olive oil. Pulse gently until semi-smooth and creamy-looking (the oil will form a creamy emulsion with the soup). Add back to the pot and stir to combine. Stir in the kale and parsley. Turn the heat off and just let everything chill out for a bit before serving. The taste gets better with time and so does the texture, IMO!
3. Season to taste (add the sherry, vinegar, and/or lemon juice at this point) and to really go next level, serve with crusty wheat bread and a little Parmesan cheese. It's called Detox Balance.
