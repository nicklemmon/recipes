1. Rinse the salt off of the fat back
2. Put the green beans in a pot and cover them in water half-way, and add a little salt (though not too much salt as the fatback will add plenty)
3. Push the fat down on the water
4. Boil the fat in the water for a few minutes, then add the drained and rinsed canned beans to the pot
5. Bring the beans to a boil and turn them down to a simmer for ?? minutes
