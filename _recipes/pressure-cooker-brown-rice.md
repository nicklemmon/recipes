1. Spray pressure cooker with cooking oil.
2. Add all ingredients to pressure cooker.
3. Once pressure is achieved, set timer for fifteen minutes.
4. Let pressure drop by its own accord and keep lid on until ready to serve.
5. This will yield a rice that is not dry, maintains a nice consistency and is far better than any stovetop version.
