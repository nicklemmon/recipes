1. Mix all ingredients together with a mixer.
2. Add the flour last a little at a time for best results.
3. Roll dough into 1-2" balls.
4. Coat balls with sugar (easiest to fill a small bowl with sugar and roll them in the sugar).
5. Place cookie balls on a cookie sheet with room for them to flatten and spread.
6. Bake at 325 degrees for 12-15 minutes. If you want them to be crunchy, bake longer.
7. Remove promptly and move to rack or parchment paper to cool.
