1. Pour 10-15ml of water in the shaker (preferably not chilled, but chilled will still do).
2. Add two tea-spoonfuls of NESCAFÉ and one tea-spoonful of sugar, or more if desired.
Shake strongly until all the water becomes foam.3. Potential use of an electric hand mixer, instead of a shaker, will make a more nice, shiny and creamy foam.
4. Pour into a glass of 250ml, add 3-4 ice cubes and chilled water to fill the glass for black NESCAFÉ Frappé. For white NESCAFÉ Frappé, add 20-30ml chilled milk. Ideal serving temperature 10 degrees Celsius.
5. Enjoy your NESCAFÉ Frappé!
